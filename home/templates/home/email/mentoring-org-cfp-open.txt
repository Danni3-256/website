Intern funding
---

All mentoring organizations need to find funding for at least one intern ($8,000 USD).
{% if fully_outreachy_funded or community.humanitarian_community or community.open_science_community %}
Outreachy has internship funding available for humanitarian and open science communities. We encourage you to apply for the Outreachy general fund when you sign up to participate. We encourage communities to apply for 1-4 interns from the Outreachy general fund.
{% endif %}{% if not fully_outreachy_funded %}
In last Outreachy cohort you participated in, your mentoring organization received funding for interns from the following sponsors:

{% for sponsorship in sponsorships %} - {{ sponsorship.name }}: ${{ sponsorship.amount }}
{% endfor %}
Do you think any of these sponsors will be able to commit to funding {{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F Y" }} interns? Outreachy organizers are happy to help you reach out to sponsors if needed.
{% endif %}
