<h2>Open Source Experience</h2>
<p>
<b>Outreachy welcomes applicants who are new to open source.</b>
</p>

<p>
It is okay if you have never contributed to open source before!
The following questions help us gather statistics.
</p>

<p>
We will not reject applications from people who are new to open source.
You are welcome here.
